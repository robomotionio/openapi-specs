    "description": "Welcome to the WhatsApp Business Platform Cloud API from Meta.\n\nIndividual developers and Business Service Providers (BSPs) can now send and receive messages using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business Platform API. Compared to the previous solutions, Cloud API is simpler to use and is a more cost-effective way for businesses to use WhatsApp.\n\nWhether you’re a business or a BSP, Cloud API provides great benefits when compared to WhatsApp On-Premises API.\n\nSo let's get started!\n\n# Installation\n\n## Quick Installation\n\nUse the `Run in Postman` button below or at the top right corner of the documentation to import this collection into your local Postman app.\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/13382743-84d01ff8-4253-4720-b454-af661f36acc2?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D13382743-84d01ff8-4253-4720-b454-af661f36acc2%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Da31742be-ce5c-4b9d-a828-e10ee7f7a5a3)| Click to fork WhatsApp Cloud API into your workspace. |\n\n# Environment\n\nThis collection includes pre-configured environments. To use the pre-configured environment for Cloud API, select **Cloud API** from the environment drop down list box at the top right corner of Postman. This automatically populates the correct environment variables listed in the table below.\n\nTo run requests in the [Get Started](#01e24b28-7896-4aee-946c-210b6945e50b) guide using a custom environment, you need to set the listed variables in the following table to values in your custom environment:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Version` | Latest [Graph API version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/). For example: **`v15.0`** |\n| `User-Access-Token` | Your user access token after signing up at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com). |\n| `WABA-ID` | Your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) ID. |\n| `Phone-Number-ID` | ID for the phone number connected to the WhatsApp Business API. You can get this with a [Get Phone Number ID request](3184f675-d289-46f1-88e5-e2b11549c418). |\n| `Business-ID` | Your Business' ID. Once you have your Phone-Number-ID, make a [Get Business Profile request](#99fd3743-46cf-46c4-95b5-431c6a4eb0b0) to get your Business' ID. |\n| `Recipient-Phone-Number` | Phone number that you want to send a WhatsApp message to. |\n| `Media-ID` | ID for the media to [send a media message](#0a632754-3788-43bf-b785-ac6a73423d5a) or [media template message](#439c926a-8a6c-4972-ab2c-d99297716da9) to your customers. |\n| `Media-URL` | URL for the media to [download media content](#cbe5ece3-246c-48f3-b338-074187dfef66). |\n| `Upload-ID` | Session ID for uploading data (images) to Meta using [Resumable Upload API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13382743/UVC5FTHT?fbclid=IwAR083mCseNzJm-JgxlIQbdF30hkAbEOHkbBaw9bA7-isGKU6uwtq1RJKc0o#ec2c5110-134c-4f2d-ba13-4d33ad13d1df). |\n\n# Changelog\n\nFor information relating to what has changed in the WhatsApp Business Platform, see [WhatsApp Business Platform Changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-platform/changelog#october-6--2022).\n\n# What's New for Cloud API\n\nThis section covers new features and updates for WhatsApp Business Platform Cloud API Postman collection. \n\n## December 13th 2022\n\nThe following features are now available on the Cloud API, hosted by Meta, with no upgrades necessary: \n\n**Improved Media Link Caching**\nFor Media message sends using links, the Cloud API now supports HTTP Caching Protocol. This allows businesses to set their preferred caching options and communicate them with the Cloud API by setting relevant HTTP Headers. To learn more about media link caching, see [Media HTTP Caching](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages#media-http-caching).  \n\n**Reduction for Webhook Retry Policy** \nCloud API calls the businesses Webhook to notify the business of message deliveries, reads, and replies. If the Webhook is down for any reason Cloud API previously retried notifying the Webhook for up to 30 days. Going forward we have reduced this number to 7 days. For more information, see our [developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks#webhook-delivery-failure). \n\n**New media endpoint that checks ownership permissions**\nIntroducing a new optional media endpoint parameter for verifying media ownership on a phone number level, which allows for differentiation for types of media owned by a specific phone number. For more information, see **API Reference**>>**Media**:\n\n* **Retrieve Media URL**\n* **Delete Media**\n\n## November 3rd 2022\n\n**Messages Per Second**\n\nCloud API now supports up to 500 (up from 350) messages per second (MPS) of combined text and media messages, by request. For more information, see [Throughput](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview#throughput) for details.\n\nIf you already have 350 MPS it will be increased to 500 MPS automatically. If you already requested 350 MPS but the process has not been completed, you will receive 500 MPS upon completion.\n\n**Document Captions**\n\nCloud API now supports captions on documents sent to and received from customers. For more information, see [Media Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object).\n\n**Error Codes**\nWe have updated our error codes documentation to be more actionable. There have been some changes to existing error codes in Graph API **`v15.0`** and above. Some error titles also have been updated. For more information, see [Error Codes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/error-codes).\n\n## October 6th 2022\n\n**Graph API v15 update**\n\nWhatsApp Cloud API has been updated for Graph API version 15.0. The `Version` environment variable for environment **Cloud API [Cloud API]** has been automatically updated to **`v15.0`**.\n\n**Embedded Signup**\n\nEmbedded Signup now supports mobile web browsers. The user interface will automatically optimize for a mobile experience when it detects that the viewer is using a mobile web browser.\n\n**Callback Override**\n\nYou can now use different callback URLs for each of your WhatsApp Business Accounts without having to create a unique app for each WhatsApp Business Account. See [Overriding the Callback URL](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup/webhooks#overriding-the-callback-url) for details.\n\n**Message Templates**\n\nText parameters (**`messages.parameters.text`**) for message templates that only use a body component (**`messages.type:body`**) can now total up to 32,768 characters. For more information, see [Parameters object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#parameter-object).\n\n**Messages Per Second**\n\nCloud API now supports up to 350 (up from 250) messages per second (MPS) of combined text and media messages, by request. For more information, see [Throughput](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview#throughput) for details.\n\nIf you already have 250 MPS it will be increased to 350 MPS automatically. If you already requested 250 MPS but the process has not been completed, you will receive 350 MPS upon completion.\n\n## September 22nd 2022 - Reaction Messages and Business Profile\n\nThe September 22nd 2022 release contains the following features:\n\n**Reactions**\n\nYou can now send and receive reactions on messages. Additionally, we have also added Webhook support for reaction messages.\n\nThe new API request has been added to **API Reference**>>**Messages**>>**Send Reply with Reaction Message**.\n\n**Business Profile**\n\nThe **`about`** field on business profiles is now supported.

Refer to the **API Reference**>>**Messages**>>**Message Object** sticker property and for sticker asset requirements.\n\n#### August 17th 2022 - Resumable Upload API requests for updating your business profile picture\n\nWhatsApp Cloud API now has three new requests in **API Reference**>>**Business Profiles**:\n\n* **Resumable Upload - Create an Upload Session**\n* **Resumable Upload - Upload File Data**\n* **Resumable Upload - Query File Upload Status**\n\nThese requests simplify uploading profile pictures to Meta. You can now get a **`profile_picture_handle`** that you can use to update pictures.\n\n## August 2nd 2022 - Graph API v14 update\nWhatsApp Cloud API has been updated for Graph API version 14.0. The `Version` environment variable for environment **Cloud API [Cloud API]** has been automatically updated to **`v14.0`**.\n\n\n## July 21st 2022\nThe July 2022 release contains the following features:\n\n* Businesses can now reply to any message in a conversation thread. Replies will include a contextual bubble referencing the replied-to message. Refer to the [Send Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages#replies) guide to learn how to reply to a message. \nFor more information on the new Postman Reply-To Requests, see [API **Reference**>>**Messages**](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13382743/UVC5FTHT#1f4f7644-cc97-40b5-b8e4-c19da268fff1). For our WhatsApp Cloud API developer docs, see [**Reference**>>**Messages**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages).\n\n* WhatsApp Cloud API now supports up to 250 messages per second (MPS) of combined sending and receiving (inclusive of text and media messages). If you are an enterprise partner you can open a Direct Support ticket to request 250 MPS throughput by selecting Question Topic: \"**Cloud API Issues**\", Request Type: \"**Request to migrate to 250 MPS throughput**\" and fill out the required information.\n\n## May 2022\nExisting direct partners and Business Service Providers (BSPs) can now send and receive messages using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business API. Compared to On-Premises API, the Cloud-based API is simpler to use and is a more cost-effective way for businesses to use WhatsApp.",

(Unless you have registered other phone numbers, this will be the only phone number in From.)\n2.  Enter the phone number you would like to message in the To field. Ensure the number is correct, and that you want to add it to your list of 5 possible message recipients —as you add phone numbers, follow the prompts on the screen to verify you have access to them. Once this number has been added, it cannot be removed from your list. Note: This limitation is only for WhatsApp-provided test phone numbers. Real phone numbers that you register do not have a limit on the number of recipients.\n3.  Once you enter a recipient phone number, the code sample on the page will be updated to demonstrate an API call that sends a test message to that number. The code sample will look like this:\n    \n\n```\ncurl -i -X POST \\\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/FROM_PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{ \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\", \"to\": \"TO_PHONE_NUMBER\", \"type\": \"template\", \"template\": { \"name\": \"hello_world\", \"language\": { \"code\": \"en_US\" } } }'Copy Code\n\n```\n\n4\\. Click **Send message** to send the first message. As an alternative, you can copy the code sample provided and execute it in your Terminal or in Postman. You have just sent a test message!\n\nThe code sample on the page is formatted for use in Unix-style terminal shells, and is expected to work on MacOS and distributions of Gnu/Linux. If you use Windows, we suggest you perform your first API call using Postman, to avoid platform-related cURL formatting concerns. If you are a Windows 10 user, cURL is available, but requires a different syntax than the one shown in the Getting Started tab to execute in PowerShell or cmd.exe. For more information, see [cURL Comes to Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/) or [cURL for Windows](https://curl.se/windows/). If you have access to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), you can also consider launching a Linux distribution and using its terminal."

To do that, you must first [file for a name change on WhatsApp Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077). Once the name is approved, you need to register your phone again under the new name.\n    \n\nBefore registering your phone, you need to verify that you own that phone number with a SMS or voice code.

This can be used in cases where you want to move to the On-Premises API or you want to use your phone number in the regular WhatsApp customer app. You can always reregister your phone with Cloud API later by repeating the registration process.\n\n**You set up** [**two-factor verification**](#fc57a30c-97e0-4e06-b74b-89fd7fc5f783) **and** [**register a phone number**](#b22af3db-9d13-4467-a7a6-4026f71984cb) **in the same API call.**\n\n#### Reminders\n\n*   To use these endpoints, you need to authenticate yourself with a system user access token with the **`whatsapp_business_messaging`** permission.\n*   If you need to find your phone number ID, see [Get Phone Number ID](#c72d9c17-554d-4ae1-8f9e-b28a94010b28)."
