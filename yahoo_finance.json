According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved.

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP.",

The US Department of Commerce announced that its \"third\" estimate for 1Q20 GDP growth was a rate of -5.0%.  This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.7% pace -- below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. Remember, these readings were for the first quarter; they will get worse in the second quarter. Still, the second quarter should be the bottom. This morning's Durable Goods report indicated an increase in spending on Durable Goods by 15.8% in May versus a decline of 17.7% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that the trade deficit in goods widened in May (bad for 2Q GDP) and that wholesale inventories declined (good for 3Q GDP, as inventories are replenished).  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that another 1.48 million people filed initial unemployment claims.  While still high, the readings have been declining from week to week.  Even so, the continuing claims number remained above 20 million. This typically has been a close approximation to the unemployment rate, which is likely to be at least 13% when reported next week.",

Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).

The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US$70 trillion, according to BMO Global Asset Management. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter and workers' rights.",

These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets.

The segments that lagged were capital investment into equipment (-3.8%, which we think is a fall-out from the trade debate) and exports (up only 1.0% and also affected by trade). In short, the headline number looked positive, but the economy is not showing strength across the board. We expect growth in the balance of 2019 and 2020 to fall into the 1.5%-2.3% range, as ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty weigh on business and consumer confidence. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.1% pace, in line with the Federal Reserve's targets.",

We think companies that raise their dividends consistently at a double-digit rate are sending off three important signals amid all the recent market volatility: 1) the company's balance sheet is strong enough to pay a dividend; 2) management is focused on providing shareholder returns; and 3) management is confident enough in the near-term outlook to raise the payout aggressively. This third factor is especially important as the economy cools off into 2020 and earnings growth slows. Here are 11 stocks that meet our double-digit dividend test and are on the Argus BUY List. They are also core holdings in our Dividend Growth Separately Managed Account and in the Dividend Growers Total Return Trust, a Unit Investment Trust sponsored by SmartTrust.",

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach subsequently has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter and workers' rights.",

Even so, growth was broad-based, including capital investments into Intellectual Products (+5.6%), Equipment (+3.4%), the all-important Personal Consumer Spending category (+3.5%) and even Federal Government Spending (+3.5%, led by Defense spending).  The segments that lagged were Housing (-3.6%), once again, and Exports (-4.9% and reflecting tariff turmoil as well as a strong dollar). The 3Q results benefited from the Trump tax cuts, which helped drive consumer spending. But the tax-cut \"sugar high\" will be winding down after one more quarter. We expect growth in 4Q in the 3% range, but look for a further slowdown into 2019-2020 as housing and exports continue to weigh. As the slowdown progresses, we anticipate that the Federal Reserve will slow down its pace of interest-rate hikes.",
