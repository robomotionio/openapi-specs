While we're running on the Essential Schedule, off peak fares remain in effect on all LIRR trains, including trains operating in traditional peak/rush hour time periods. To minimize contact with crew members, use MTA eTix on smartphones and activate eTix just before boarding. Ticket machines are available at most stations for cash &amp; credit card purchases. Remember: If you're using MTA services, you must wear a face covering (mask/bandana/scarf) at the station and for the entire duration of your train ride.",
