    "description": "# API Service\n\nThis Service will only export external apis\n\n\nWelcome to Salessimplify's API Documentation. We've designed this document to help developers and salessimplify users fully understand and integrate our API for a seamless and easy deployment. These APIs enable you to utilize most of your salessimplify account's panel features fully.\n\nWe've listed all the APIs, their required parameters, and their example requests and responses on the right for easy understanding. The easiest way to start using the salessimplify APIs is by clicking the **Run in Postman** button above. The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a free tool that helps developers run and debug API requests.\n\nOur APIs are based around REST architecture and use the basic [HTTP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes) request methods. Our APIs accept [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) - encoded body requests and return data in the same form.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nFirst, you need to register with salessimplify and create an account. Click on this [link](https://app.salessimplify.com/auth/registration) to complete the sign-up process.\n\nAfter the sign-up process is complete, follow the enlisted steps to create an API user:\n\n1.  Open your salessimplify account and navigate to the right-hand panel.\n2.  Click On **Profile Icon => Admin Settings => API => Create an API**.\n3.  On the pop-up menu, fill in the **API Name**.\n4.  Click on **'Add API'**. On successful completion, you should have a new API token generated.\n5.  Copy this token and use it to authenticate your further API calls.\n    \n\n# Document and API Usage Guidelines\n\n*   Our APIs use the basic HTTP request codes: *POST*, *GET*, *PATCH*, *DELETE*.\n*   You can select the required response and request code language by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the top.\n*   You can import and test all our full API collection in the Postman app by clicking on the **' Run in Postman'** button.\n*   **Note**: Any requests made using the valid API credentials will affect the real-time data in your salessimplify account.\n*   Authorization: Bearer\n*   All the APIs are provided with their appropriate example requests and responses for successful and failed calls.\n    \n\n# Errors and Response codes\n\nWhile using salessimplify's APIs, you may run into some standard response and error codes. The most common ones are listed along with their descriptions as follows:\n\n| **RESPONSE CODE** | **DESCRIPTION** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `200` & `202` - **OK** & **Accepted** | Everything worked as expected, and you'll get a response. Some APIs may respond with an error message if data is invalid. |\n| `400` - **Bad Request** | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. |\n| `401` - **Unauthorized** | There is some error during validation. You need to check your token or credentials. |\n| `404` - **Not Found** | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested does not exist. |\n| `405` - **Method Not Allowed** | The API was accessed using the wrong method. Check your HTTP method. |\n| `422` - **Unprocessable Entity** | It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled. Try checking your code for errors. |\n| `429` - **Too Many Requests** | You have exceeded the API call rate limit. |\n| `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` - **Server Errors** | Some server error has occurred. Some APIs may show this due to syntax or parameter errors. Try contacting support if this persists. |\n\n# Common Errors In Lead, Deal, Activity, People, Company and Product Module\n| **RESPONSE CODE** | **Error** | **Type**| **Example** | \n--- | --- |--- | ---\n`400` | You dont Have permission to perform `{edit/delete}` operation on selected `{lead/people/company/deal/product}` module. Contact admin to give permission. | Permission Restriction | You dont Have permission to perform edit operation on selected lead module. Contact admin to give permission.\n`400`  | You dont have permission to `{import/export}` data.| Permission Restriction |You dont have permission to import data.\n`400` | You dont have permission to `{edit/delete}` `{lead/people/company/deal/product}`.| Permission Restriction | You dont have permission to delete product.\n`400` | Current feature is not part of your subsccribed plan. please upgrade your plan to get currenct feature access.| Billing Plan Restriction | Current feature is not part of your subsccribed plan. please upgrade your plan to get currenct feature access.\n`400` |You don't have permission to create more than `{record_limit}` records. Please upgrade your plan to create more records.| Billing Plan Restriction | You don't have permission to create more than 50000 records. Please upgrade your plan to create more records.\n\n\n# Webhooks\n\nWebhooks allows you to receive programmatic notifications from Sales Simplify regarding changes to your data as they occur.\n\nInstead of requiring you to pull information through our API, webhooks will push the information to your endpoint. When any of these events are triggered, Salessimplify sends this notification as a HTTP POST request with a JSON body, at the termination point you specify.\n\n**Setup**:\n\n*   Log in to your Sales Simplify account\n*   Go to Admin Settings > Webhooks\n*   Add the webhook URL and Select actions.\n*   Save\n    \n\nWhen we detect any change salessimplify in data, a POST request is made to the callback URL you added to your Sales simplify account.\n\n**Webhook Specifications:**\n\n*   Method: POST\n*   The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`      \n\n**Webhook format**:\n```json\n{\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"action\": \"added\",\n      \"account_id\": xxxxx,\n      \"user_id\": xxxxx,\n      \"timestamp\": 1523440213000\n    },\n    \"retry\": 0,\n    \"current\": (the object data as of this update),\n    \"previous\": (the object data prior to this update),\n    \"event\": \"event name\"\n}\n```\n\n**Webhook Data Format**:\n\nmeta.action/event  |  current | previous\n--- | --- | ---\n`Lead Added` | LeadSchema | {}\n`Lead Updated` | LeadSchema |  LeadSchema\n`Lead Merged` | LeadSchema | [LeadSchema, LeadSchema]\n`Lead Deleted` |  {} | LeadSchema\n`Deal Added` |  DealSchema | {}\n`Deal Updated` | DealSchema | DealSchema\n`Deal Deleted` | {} | DealSchema\n`Activity Added` |  ActivitySchema | {}\n`Activity Updated` | ActivitySchema | ActivitySchema\n`Activity Deleted` | {} |  ActivitySchema\n`People Added` |PeopleSchema | {}\n`People Updated` | PeopleSchema | PeopleSchema\n`People Merged` | PeopleSchema | [PeopleSchema, PeopleSchema] \n`People Deleted` | {} | PeopleSchema\n`Company Added` | CompanySchema | {}\n`Company Updated` | CompanySchema | CompanySchema\n`Company Merged` | CompanySchema | [CompanySchema, CompanySchema]\n`Company Deleted` | {} |CompanySchema\n`Product Added` |  ProductSchema | {}\n`Product Updated` | ProductSchema | ProductSchema\n`Product Merged` | ProductSchema | [ProductSchema, ProductSchema]\n`Product Deleted` | {}|ProductSchema\n\n\n\n**Schemas**:\n\nSchema defines the data object of approprite module.\n1.

If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. The `customFields` is a object represent all custom field keys with there value which are set in lead. for example\n```js\n{\n    ...,   //lead system data\n    customFields :{\n        key1: <value>\n        key2: <value>\n    }\n}\n```\n\n###  Query Parameters\nFiled | Type |is Required | Default Value | Description\n---|---|---|---|---\npageNo | `Number` | true | 1 | For pagination, the page of entries to be returned.

Whenever a user wanted some extra data on a company where he can't utilize pre-defined system fields, their custom fields are used. \n\n## Data Field Response\nField Name  | Description\n---|---\n_id | Field unique identification id  \nfieldInputType | It defined input behaviour of current field.
